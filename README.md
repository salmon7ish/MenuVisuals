# MenuVisuals
This is the demonstration video of the BTech project (June 2017), in which we created an Android app that can scan the options in the Restaurant menu card and give a visual description of it. This is meant to facilitate the users (especially the non-English users) that go to foreign places and don't understand the native language but still want to enjoy the authentic dishes. Briefly, we extract the menu item (food item) which is sent to a database as a query that maps a food item to its description. 
Here in the video, we show the translation of a Mexican dish to its Visual description.
